<h2 id="link-4-git-snippets-i-use-daily">4 Git snippets I use daily</h2>
<p>I started my first full-time job as a programmer this year, which means I've been picking up <em>a lot</em> of new tricks in a pretty quick timeframe. Naturally, I started automating the workflows I use day-in and day-out 😁</p>
<p>Stop me if you've seen this workflow before:</p>
<ol>
<li>I picked up a ticket on JIRA</li>
<li>I need to pull the latest main branch</li>
<li>I need to checkout a new branch</li>
<li>I need to push that branch to origin to and collaborate with my team and open my PR</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll probably do this 5+ times in one day if we're in a bug-squashing flow. But when I'm hurrying, it's so easy to either <strong>a)</strong> work off an old &quot;main&quot; branch, or <strong>b)</strong> do the <strong>copy-paste of shame</strong> before your PR:</p>
<pre><code>To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin crap-not-again
</code></pre>
<p><em>You know you cringe a little every time this pops up</em> 😬</p>
<p>To mitigate this, I've created my <strong>fantastic 4</strong> shortcuts for slamming through my daily tasks 💪</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># Stash what I'm working on and checkout the latest master</span>

<p>Let's understand what these commands are doing a little more:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>gimme:</code></strong> This command assumes you might <em>not</em> be on the main branch just yet. It will first stash anything you're working on, including &quot;untracked&quot; / new files with the <code>-u</code> flag. Then, it will head over to the main branch and pull the latest. That <code>-r</code> flag will be sure to &quot;rebase&quot; onto the latest, preventing unecessary merge conflicts.</li>
<li><strong><code>yoink:</code></strong> This builds off of <code>gimme</code> a little bit. Instead of remaining on the main branch when we're done, we'll head <em>back</em> to the branch we were just on using the <code>-</code> parameter. This is super convenient for grabbing the latest changes to <a href="https://egghead.io/lessons/git-push-a-rebased-local-branch-by-using-force-with-lease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">force rebase the branch</a> we're working on.</li>
<li><strong><code>woosh:</code></strong> This fixes our <code>--set-upstream</code> problem from earlier. Instead of pushing to origin later, this lets you check out a new branch and push <em>right away.</em> Yes, there's some cases when you don't want your local branch on the remote, but this is pretty rare in my experience. And if you've never seen the <code>HEAD</code> parameter before... <strong>remember that one!</strong> It's a super slick way to auto-fill the name of your current branch instead of typing it out by hand 🔥</li>
<li><strong><code>boop:</code></strong> This command goes full-circle. It'll stash your current work, grab the latest main branch, <em>and</em> push it up to origin before you start working. This is the command I use the most!</li>
</ul>
<p>Also gonna mention <a href="https://www.jason.af/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Jason Lengstorf</a> (<em>the lord of boops</em>) for the naming convention here 😁</p>
<h2 id="link-building-a-second-brain-in-vs-code">Building a second brain in VS Code</h2>
<p>This year was all about <em>writing, writing and <strong>more</strong> writing</em> for me. There's just so much knowledge to pick up as a new full stack developer, yet it always feels so difficult to find what I wrote even a week ago!</p>
<p>I've struggled from notetaking app fatigue for years now. But at long last... I think I've found a semi-perfect home for everything I write both on <em>and</em> off the clock.</p>
<h3 id="link-enter-the-second-brain">Enter the second brain 🧠</h3>
<p>I'd been hearing about this concept for a while now, but never realized it's an actual <em>strategy</em> to notetaking. As you'd expect, it's all about writing as much as possible, so you can build a brain's worth of knowledge in <strong>note form.</strong></p>
<p>This concept starts with the <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Zettelkasten Method</a> used back in the pen-and-paper ages. It's built on some pretty basic principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every note is treated as a <em>unique</em> collection of thoughts, tagged by a unique ID of some sort</li>
<li>Notes should form an <strong>ever-sprawling tree</strong> of connected ideas / thoughts. This is pulled off with &quot;links&quot; between notes (references to those unique IDs), much like hyperlinks on the web!</li>
<li>You may index multiple &quot;trees&quot; of notes with tags or tables of contents, assuming your Zettelkasten grows pretty large</li>
</ol>
<p>There's countless nuggets of advice on how to do a Zettelkasten <em>right</em>. But overall, it's clear that a physical Zettelkasten <strong>maps perfectly to how the web works.</strong> So, why not use a bunch of HTML files to create one? Or better yet, markdown files?</p>
<h3 id="link-using-vs-code-foam">Using VS Code + Foam</h3>
<p>I discovered a project called <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Foam</a> recently that's... not really a stand-alone project; it's a collection of extensions that work well together, with some <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes/recipes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">helpful guides</a> on how to make the most of them.</p>
<p>All you need to do is <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">clone a repository</a> and watch the magic happen! It'll recommend all the extensions you should need to edit, link, and view your notes. But at the end of the day, you're really just writing a bunch of markdown files on your computer + some added benefits.</p>
<h4 id="link-getting-a-birds-eye-view">Getting a birds-eye view 🗺</h4>
<p>It's worth discussing a crucial part of the Foam style of notetaking: <strong>you never need to group notes by directory.</strong> We're so used to using file systems to organize everything, but let's be honest, that's not how our brain works!</p>
<p>Foam thrives on connecting notes with <em>links</em>, rather than folder hierarchies. This makes it much easier to define notes that might be referenced in a ton of places. Instead of finding the <em>exact</em> directory where a note should live, you just need to reference the file itself.</p>
<p>Foam will help you find any patterns that naturally emerge from links with a <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/features/graph-visualisation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">graph visualization extension</a>. It's basically one big <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPCuQMKVh0Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">map of your head</a> that you can click into and explore!</p>

<p>This is the graph generated by my <a href="https://twitter.com/BHolmesDev/status/1329265837828677632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">recent challenge to learn Rust lang</a>. Notice how this doesn't <em>quite</em> match up to a parent-child relationship that directory trees demand. For instance, &quot;Intro to structs&quot; on the far left gets referenced by &quot;Enums&quot; <em>and</em> &quot;Rust ownership.&quot; But you couldn't have the same file sitting in multiple directories at once! That's the beauty of using free-form links; <strong>anything can reference anything else</strong>, so it's less of a <em>tree</em> and more of a purposeful, tangled-up birds nest 😁</p>

<p><em>Metaphor for my brain</em></p>
<p>If you use VS Code every day like me, this is super easy to dive into for the first time. Definitely give it shot if <em>blog more</em> is one of your New Year's resolutions 🎉</p>
<h2 id="link-everything-is-a-state-machine">Everything is a state machine</h2>
<p>You're a state machine. I'm a state machine. <em>The world is a state machine.</em></p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/assets/md-images/6de4da2e-600.webp 600w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 720px, 100vw"><img alt="Meme with two astronauts looking at the earth. One asks "wait, it's all state machines?" and the other replies, gun in hand, "always has been."" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="../../assets/md-images/6de4da2e-600.jpg" width="600" height="337"></picture></p>
<p>...okay jokes aside, state machines really do apply to everything 😆</p>
<p>You may have heard of <a href="https://xstate.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">XState</a> as a solution to &quot;global state management&quot; in your JS apps. This is true, but the idea of state machines <strong>is more of a <em>way of thinking</em> than <em>just another library to learn.</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="link-visualizing-your-state">Visualizing your state</h3>
<p>Diagramming is really XState's bread and butter. With most state management tools, the actual progression from one action / state / reducer to another can be pretty tough to trace. In XState, <a href="https://xstate.js.org/viz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">they have a dedicated sandbox to work from!</a></p>
<p>I could come up with some wild example to showcase how XState works, but the default template already does a great job:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Holben888/personal-blog/main/get-s***-done-2020/3-state-machine-visualizer.gif" alt="3-state-machine-visualizer" loading="lazy"  /></p>
<p>Let's break down some important XState lingo here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finite states</strong> are those words surrounded by a rectangle (idle, loading, etc.). If you come from Redux like me, you can look at each of these like mini-reducers. They each have unique actions that they're listening for, which may cause you to progress from one reducer to the next.</li>
<li><strong>Actions</strong> are defined by those gray bubbles between our finite states (FETCH, RESOLVE, etc.). These can do a few interesting things: progress you to another finite state, set some &quot;global&quot; state for the whole machine (see the next bullet), or fire off some &quot;side effects&quot; that do things <em>outside</em> the machine. For instance, the <code>FETCH</code> action might kick off an API call of some sort. If that API call comes back successfully, we'll fire the <code>RESOLVE</code> action (which our &quot;loading&quot; state picks up).</li>
<li><strong>Context</strong> is some global state shared by <em>all</em> states in the machine. This is just one big JS object you can assign new values to and read from whenever you want. In this case, we have a count of how many times we &quot;retried&quot; our fetch, which gets updated on the <code>RETRY</code> action with <strong><code>do / assign retries</code></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This approach has <em>countless</em> benefits, but the biggest one for me: <strong>you can use any framework you want with XState, or even no framework at all!</strong> This makes me super comfortable going all-in on the library since I can take it with me wherever I go 😁</p>
<p>To get your feet wet in this brave new world, I found some high quality demos around the Internet worth checking out:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiT4Q1ntvzg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">This one</a> on modeling UI with state machines across frameworks.</strong> Best conference talk on the subject hands down.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czi24DqUfSA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">This one</a> on building a more complex ReactJS form.</strong> It's longer, but worth your time!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osaszd2aU9U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">This one</a> on creating a Vanilla JS drag-and-drop interaction.</strong> This is more CSS-intensive and speaks to the <code>className</code> trick I showed above.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="link-one-line-state-machines-with-typescript">One-line state machines with TypeScript</h3>
<p>I started using this pattern more and more throughout the year. This actually <em>doesn't</em> use any libraries at all! In short, it's neat shorthand to collapse an ever-growing sea of booleans:</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>formIdle<span class="token punctuation">,</span> setFormIdle<span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> React<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">useState</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>formInvalid<span class="token punctuation">,</span> setFormInvalid<span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> React<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">useState</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>formSubmitting<span class="token punctuation">,</span> setFormSubmitting<span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> React<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">useState</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>formSubmitted<span class="token punctuation">,</span> setFormSubmitted<span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> React<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">useState</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>...into a single, type-safe state:</p>
<pre class="language-ts"><code class="language-ts"><span class="token keyword">type</span> <span class="token class-name">FormState</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'idle'</span> <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token string">'invalid'</span> <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token string">'submitting'</span> <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token string">'submitted'</span>
<span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>formState<span class="token punctuation">,</span> setFormState<span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> React<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token generic-function"><span class="token function">useState</span><span class="token generic class-name"><span class="token operator">&lt;</span>FormState<span class="token operator">></span></span></span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"idle"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This fixes the age-old problem tools like <a href="https://hackernoon.com/handling-loading-actions-the-proper-way-in-redux-t3k36e8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Redux seemed to encourage</a>: you have a bunch of booleans representing unique states, <strong>but only one boolean should be flipped &quot;on&quot; at a given time.</strong> It's a hassle making sure all your boolean's are <code>false</code> when they're supposed to be, so why not have a boolean with more than 2 states?</p>
<p>There are a number of other benefits to this approach like flipping CSS classes at the right times. <strong><a href="https://dev.to/bholmesdev/writing-a-state-machine-in-one-line-with-typescript-3h9d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Check out this article</a></strong> for some interactive code examples ✨</p>
<h2 id="link-functional-programming-with-ramdajs">Functional programming with RamdaJS</h2>
<p>Across the tech stack my full-time job demands, <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-functional-programming/#higher-order-functions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">functional programming</a> has been <em>the</em> common thread for me to pick up.</p>
<p>The functional programming community has flourished with all the static type checking goodness that TypeScript brought. Heck, there's an <strong><a href="https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">entire helper library</a></strong> for nearly every concept in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhgq-BqyZ7i5lOqOqqRiS0U5SwTmPpHQ5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">category theory</a> book!</p>
<p>My knowledge of true, mathematical FP is still very surface level right now. Still, I've definitely found my &quot;gateway drug&quot; into this new world: <strong>I need to transform a big blob of data into a different looking blob of data, and I'm gonna chain 10 functions together to do it</strong> 😎</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://ramdajs.com/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RamdaJS</a></strong> really is the missing toolkit JS needs for these acrobatics. I could ramble about each little function in their every-sprawling docs, but let's hit the biggest highlights.</p>
<h3 id="link-boolean-operations">Boolean operations</h3>
<p>First off, Ramda throws you some nice shortcuts for combining multiple arrays. Let's consider some basic inventory management for our coffee shop. Before someone can check out, we need to exclude any items that are out of stock. Normally, we'd write some function like this one:</p>

<p>This works well enough... but it's not super readable. Watch us rewrite this sort of operation in a single stroke:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token comment">// subtract out all the outOfStockItems from orders</span>
<span class="token keyword">const</span> validOrders <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">difference</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>orders<span class="token punctuation">,</span> outOfStockItems<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token comment">// -> ["Cold brew", "Latte"]</span>
</code></pre>
<p>We can do all kinds of things from here! For instance, we could filter out multiple arrays at once by <code>union</code>ing them together:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">const</span> validOrders <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">difference</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>orders<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token function">union</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>outOfStockItems<span class="token punctuation">,</span> itemsOutForDelivery<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>...or figure out which items we <em>should</em> include using a SQL-inspired <code>innerJoin</code>:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token comment">// basically, filter our menuItems based on which ones were ordered</span>
<span class="token keyword">const</span> itemsOrdered <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">innerJoin</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">item<span class="token punctuation">,</span> order</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> item<span class="token punctuation">.</span>name <span class="token operator">===</span> order<span class="token punctuation">,</span> menuItems<span class="token punctuation">,</span> validOrders<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Boolean operations like these are certainly not a unique concept. Still, I'm glad Ramda includes all of them with a <a href="https://ramdajs.com/repl?v=0.27.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">nice REPL playground</a> to boot. If it's your first time seeing boolean operations, <strong>I highly recommend <a href="https://boolean.method.ac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this interactive tutorial</a></strong> 🔥</p>
<h3 id="link-formatting-in-bulk-with-evolve">Formatting in bulk with <code>evolve</code></h3>
<p>Okay, this helper really blew my socks off. I'm sure you've run into this sort of pattern before when you try to transform one object into another one:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">const</span> orders <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  name<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"Macchiatto"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
  options<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
		roomForCream<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    cream<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
      quantity<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"1tbsp"</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token operator">...</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span>
<span class="token comment">// now, we want to loop over all of these and convert that "quantity" to an int.</span>
orders<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">map</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">order</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>

	<span class="token operator">...</span>order<span class="token punctuation">,</span>
  options<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

    cream<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
      <span class="token comment">// ...and finally, parse quantity to an int</span>
      quantity<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token function">parseInt</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>order<span class="token punctuation">.</span>options<span class="token punctuation">.</span>cream<span class="token punctuation">.</span>quantity<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Not bad, but all that dot chaining is making my head spin. We also have to remember all of the keys at each level so they don't disappear on us. The spread operator cleaned up this process for us, but it's still easy to forget (especially if you don't have type checking!). If only we could <em>just</em> modify the keys we care about, without all the nested dots.</p>
<p><strong>This is exactly with <code>evolve</code> does!</strong> 🎉</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js">orders<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">map</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>
	<span class="token function">evolve</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  	<span class="token comment">// ignore the properties we *don't* want to change, like the name</span>
    options<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
      <span class="token comment">// ignore roomForCream too</span>
      cream<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
        <span class="token comment">// and just put a reference to the parseInt function as-is. Don't even call it!</span>
        quantity<span class="token operator">:</span> parseInt
      <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
	<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>There's some serious benefits to this approach. Not only can we omit keys we don't want to change, but we can modify deeply nested fields without much trouble! You'll also notice we can just pass <code>evolve</code> into our map directly, without passing in the <code>order</code> like we're used to doing (i.e. <code>map(order =&gt; evolve(order))</code>). This is because all Ramda functions are <strong>curried</strong>, which you can learn a bit more about from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36314/what-is-currying" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this Stack Overflow answer</a> 😁 Spoiler: it's an awesome feature.</p>

<p>I know 2020 hit a lot of people hard this year. If you're struggling with family, dealing with kids at home, finding a new job, losing your mind indoors... well, at least you made it through to today 🙂</p>
